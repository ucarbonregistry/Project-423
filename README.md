purpose vehicle (SPV) owned by Leap Green Energy Private Limited (Project Proponent). The
total installed capacity of Ivy Ecoenergy is 164 MW, comprising 89 wind turbine generators
(WTGs). This includes 61 Inox WTGs with a capacity of 2 MW each and 28 Suzlon WTGs with a
capacity of 1.5 MW each, located in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. M/s. Inox
Wind Infrastructure Services Limited provides all Engineering, Procurement, and Construction
(EPC), as well as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services.

➢ The Vanilla Clean Power wind farm bundle is owned by M/s. Vanilla Clean Power Pvt Ltd, with
a total installed capacity of 64 MW, consisting of 32 WTGs at the Dangri site in Rajasthan.
Initially, the project was under Inox Renewables Limited. M/s. Inox Renewable (Jaisalmer)
Limited, the power producer, assigned the project to M/s. Vanilla Clean Power Private Limited,
with its registered office at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu (India). Vanilla Clean Power Private Limited
is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) owned by Leap Green Energy Private Limited (Project
Proponent), located at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. All EPC and O&M services are provided by M/s.
Inox Wind Infrastructure Services Limited.

The generated electricity from the wind turbine generators (WTGs) in the bundles are connected to
the state electric utility grids of RJ, MP and Maharashtra.

The wind farm bundle Sr. No 01 (Ivy Eco energy) is owned by Ivy Ecoenergy India Pvt Limited.
Ivy Ecoenergy India Pvt Ltd. is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) owned by Leap Green Energy
Private Limited (Project Proponent or PP) 4th Floor, Caledon Square, Avinashi Road, Peelamedu,
Coimbatore - 641 004 Tamilnadu. Leap Green Energy Private Limited is a fast growing and
multifaceted power generating company based out of Coimbatore, India. Leap Green aims to create
mass awareness on use of Green Power by committing to generation of power through renewable
resources. The total installed capacity of Ivy Ecoenergy is 164 MW and consists of 89 Wind turbine
generators (WTGs), out of this the 61 WTG (Inox) of capacity 2 MW and 28 WTG (Suzlon) of 1.5
MW capacities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The entire Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (EPC) including Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services are
provided by Inox Wind Infrastructure Services Limited.

The project has a capacity of 228 MW and has been commissioned in phases over different years.
The first phase of 12 MW capacities was commissioned in March 2008, while the second phase of
30 MW capacities was commissioned in September 2009. Another 54 mw was added in july 2012.
Initially this total 96 MW was owned by Gujarat Fluorochemicals, in 2017 they transferred their
business ownership to Inox renewables limited. M/s. Inox Renewable (Jaisalmer) Limited i.e. the
Power Producer has assigned its project to M/s. Ivy Ecoenergy India Pvt Limited keeping the
registered office at 484, Kamaraj Road, Singanallur, Coimbatore - 641015, Tamilnadu (INDIA).
The 132 mw capacity of wind project were owned by Inox renewables limited over the time, out of
132 mw the 68 mw capacity wind project the Inox renewables has assigned its project to Ivy Eco
energy India Pvt Ltd. So the total capacity under Ivy Eco Energy is 164 MW.

The wind farm bundle Sr. No 02 (Vanilla Clean Power) is owned by Vanilla Clean Power Pvt Ltd.
The total installed capacity by Vanilla power is 64 MW and consists of 32 WTG in Dangri site of
Rajasthan. Initially this project was under the Inox renewables limited. M/s. Inox Renewable
(Jaisalmer) Limited i.e. the Power Producer has assigned its project to M/s. Vanilla Clean Power
Private Limited keeping the registered office at 484, Kamaraj Road, Uppilipalayam, Coimbatore -
641015, Tamilnadu (INDIA). M/s. Vanilla Clean Power Private Limited is a special purpose vehicle
(SPV) owned by Leap Green Energy Private Limited (Project Proponent or PP) 4th Floor, Caledon
Square, Avinashi Road, Peelamedu, Coimbatore - 641 004 Tamilnadu. The entire Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (EPC) including Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services are
provided by M/s. Inox Wind Infrastructure Services Limited.

The generated electricity from the WTGs is connected to the state electric utility grids of Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The bundled wind power projects are operational activities with
continuous reduction of GHGs, currently being applied for voluntary carbon offset units (CoUs)
under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR). The commissioning date of the first WTG in the
bundle is considered as the start date of the project activity and is recorded as 30/03/2008.
In the absence of the project activity, electricity would have been delivered to the grid by the
operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuelbased generation sources in the grid. As is the nature of wind projects (renewable energy), no fossil
fuel is involved for power generation in the project activity. The electricity produced by the project
is directly contributing to climate change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs, i.e. CO2) into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent amount of
power at grid.

The project activity is hence the installation of new grid connected renewable power plants/units.
The baseline scenario and scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity are
both the same.

The project activity is displacing an estimated annual net electricity generation i.e., 307,002 MWh
from the Indian grid system, which otherwise would have been generated by the operation of fossil
fuel-based grid-connected power plant. The estimated annual average CO2e emission reductions by
the project activity is expected to be 276,302 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved
during the first CoU period shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
Since the project activity will generate electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy
source it does not cause any negative impacts on the environment and thereby contributes to climate
change mitigation efforts.

PRIOR HISTORY
__________
Out of the 228 MW capacity of this project, 10.5 MW of wind power Ossiya site and 19.5 MW
Ossiya site are registered in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and gold standard registry and
12 MW Sadia site is applied only in CDM.

Among the registered sites only 10.5 MW wind project Ossiya site has received CER for the
period 01/01/2013 to 31/07/2014, the rest projects are only registered but have not been issued
carbon credits.

PP is requesting issuance of carbon offsets in UCR, after the period of previous issuance carbon
credits (01/01/2013 - 31/07/2014) in 10.5 mw ossiya site, i.e. crediting period will start from
01/08/2014 only at 10.5 mw ossiya site, And remaining site crediting period will commence from
the date of commissioning or as per UCR guideline of crediting period (i.e. from January 2013
whichever is latest). This project is not registered with any other voluntary market (National or
International) in said vintage period in PCN. Hence, the criteria for double counting is not
applicable for the project, for the claimed period.
